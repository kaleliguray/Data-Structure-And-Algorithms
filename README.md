## Analysis of Algorithms
* By understanding time and space complexity, we can assess how efficiently an algorithm performs in terms of both time and memory usage.

### Time Complexity
* Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute.
* This is influenced by the input processed by the algorithm.

### Space (Memory) Complexity
* Space complexity is the amount of memory or space required for an algorithm to run. 
* It is determined by the memory needed to process the input by the algorithm.

## Asymptotic Analysis of An Algorithm
- Asymptotic analysis is a method used to evaluate the performance of an algorithm concerning the input size and its increase.
- Unlike measuring the actual running time, asymptotic analysis focuses on understanding how the time and space taken by an algorithm grow as the input size increases.
- This allows us to assess the algorithm's efficiency in a more generalized manner, providing insights into its scalability without getting into specific timing details.

### Asymptotic Notations
- Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools employed to describe the running time of an algorithm in relation to the input size. These notations provide a concise and abstract way to express how the algorithm's efficiency scales as the input size grows, allowing for a more generalized analysis of its performance.

  <li>Average Case - Theta Notation (Î¸) </li>
  <li>Worst Case - Big O Notation (O) </li>
</ol>
  
#### Omega Notation (Î©)
* Omega notation (Î©) is a formal method to represent the lower bound of an algorithm's running time.
* In this context, lower bound refers to the minimum amount of time an algorithm can take to complete for any given input.
* Î© provides insight into the best-case scenario, helping to understand the inherent efficiency of an algorithm.

#### Big O Notation (O)
* Big O notation (O) is used to denote the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.
* It provides an estimation of the longest amount of time an algorithm can take to complete for any given input.
* This notation is particularly useful for understanding the worst-case scenario in terms of efficiency.

#### Theta Notation (Î¸)
* Theta notation (Î¸) serves the purpose of expressing both the upper and lower bounds of an algorithm's running time.
* It provides a more balanced view by determining the average amount of time an algorithm may take to complete.
* This notation is helpful for a more comprehensive analysis of an algorithm's efficiency.

## Rules To Calculate Big O Notation
- Single Processor: The analysis assumes a single processor for computation.
- Sequential Execution: The algorithm performs sequential execution of statements.
- Assignment Operation: Each assignment operation takes 1 unit of time.

    Example: int x = 5; takes 1 unit of time.
  
- Return Statement: Each return statement takes 1 unit of time.

    Example: return x; takes 1 unit of time.

- Arithmetical Operation: Each arithmetical operation takes 1 unit of time.

    Example: x = x + y; takes 1 unit of time.

- Logical Operation: Each logical operation takes 1 unit of time.

    Example: x && y; takes 1 unit of time.
    
- Other Small/Single Operation: Any other small or single operation also takes 1 unit of time.

- Drop Lower Order Terms: In the Big O notation, lower-order terms are dropped.

    Example: If T=n2+3n+1T=n2+3n+1, then it is represented as O(n2)O(n2).

- Drop Constant Multipliers: Constant multipliers are dropped in the Big O notation.
    Example: If T=3n2+6n+1T=3n2+6n+1, then it is represented as O(n2)O(n2).

These rules help simplify the expression and provide a clearer understanding of the algorithm's time complexity in terms of its growth concerning the input size.
